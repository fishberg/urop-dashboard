# Requesting a Rec Letter from Jon

1. Reach out via email to formally request a letter of recommendation from Jon, and cc me on the message. To allow ample time, be sure to give at least 6 weeks lead time (the more the better!).
2. Assuming Jon agrees, send me the following information over Slack: 
    * Deadline(s) (**Make sure this is clearly stated and at the top of the message!**)
    * Purpose for the letter(s) (i.e., job, grad school, fellowship, award, etc.)
    * Short description of the specific application(s) (e.g., "The X fellowship provides financial support for rising STEM leaders to pursue summer research.")
    * Purpose for applying (e.g., "Looking to use funds support my research.")
    * Any important links associated with the application (i.e., main webpage, links to examples, links to recommender guidelines, link to where to submit recommendations, etc.)
    * List all the ways you interacted with Jon/me, and what semesters those interactions occurred (e.g., "Took Signals and Systems Fall 2022", "UROP Spring 2022 + Fall 2023", etc.)
    * Things you'd like us to highlight (e.g., coursework, research topics, personality traits, etc.)
