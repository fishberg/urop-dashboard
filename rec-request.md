# Requesting a Rec Letter from Jon / Andrew

## Step 1: Talk to Andrew

Talk to me so I know you are looking for a rec letter. This way I can keep an active eye out for the email (i.e., the next step) and talk to Jon. Also, depending on the circumstances, I might have some special instructions. **DO NOT MOVE ON TO STEP 2 UNTIL WE FIRST HAVE AN IN-PERSON CONVERSATION!**

## Step 2: Reach Out

Reach out via email to formally request a letter of recommendation from Jon, and cc me on the message. To allow ample time, be sure to give at least 6 weeks lead time (the more the better!).

## Step 3: Provide Information

Assuming Jon agrees (he usually should), I will work with him to craft an appropriate letter. To do this, I will need you to send me the following information (preferably over Slack): 

1. Deadline(s) (**Make sure this is clearly stated and at the top of the message!**)
2. Clear instructions on how/where to submit the letter. Often this is a website URL, an address to mail/email, or an link we will be directly emailed (that we need to keep an eye out for).
3. Purpose for the letter(s) (i.e., job, grad school, fellowship, award, etc.)
4. Short description of the specific application(s) (e.g., "The X fellowship provides financial support for rising STEM leaders to pursue summer research.")
5. Purpose for applying (e.g., "Looking to use funds support my research.")
6. Any important links associated with the application (i.e., main webpage, call for applications, links to examples, links to recommender guidelines, etc.)
7. List all the ways you interacted with Jon/me, and what semesters those interactions occurred (e.g., "Took Signals and Systems Fall 2022", "UROP Spring 2022 + Fall 2023", etc.)
8. Things you'd like us to highlight (e.g., coursework, research topics, personality traits, etc.)
9. An up-to-date copy of your resume or CV

## Step 4: Follow Through

Send an email reminder to Jon/me 1 week before any deadline and the day of. While this shouldn't be necessary once we receive the specifics in Step 3, this ensures nothing accidently slips through the cracks!
