# Requesting Building Swipe Access

## Step 1: Complete the Google Form

If you are collaborating with Andrew (or ACL) and need swipe access to any/all of our spaces in Building 31, please complete [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/zxoUsNbXRh1sxnpc6).

Specifically we require:
* Which Bldg 31 spaces do you need access to?
  * e.g., office space, highbay, workshop, etc.
* Kerberos ID
* MIT ID Number
* Last Name
* First Name
* Cellphone Number

*(Yes, I actually need a cellphone number to get your swipe access approved. For safety reasons, the building managers want a cellphone on record for anyone with access to these spaces.)*

## Step 2: Notifying Andrew

Once you submit the Google Form, please reach out directly to Andrew (Slack preferred) so he can review your request.

## Step 3: Paperwork Approval

Assuming your Google Form submission is in good order, I will submit the paperwork for approval.
Know that once I submit the paperwork, **the approval process is (unfortunately) out of my hands** -- in the past, approval process can be as quick as a few days (yay!) or as long as a few weeks (boo!). 
That being said, I do send weekly "reminder/nudge" emails to the approvers as long as I have an outstanding request.

I appreciate your patience!

## Step 4: Approved

When I hear your paperwork has been approved, I will let you know. After approval, the door access can take up to 24hrs to propogate (but in practice, this appears to be approximately 5mins).
