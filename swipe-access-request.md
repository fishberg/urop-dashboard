# Step 1: Requesting Swipe Access

If you are collaborating with Andrew (or ACL) and need swipe access to any/all of our spaces in Building 31 send me a note (Slack preferred) with the following information:
* Which Bldg 31 spaces do you need access to?
  * e.g., office space, highbay, workshop, etc.
* Last Name
* First Name
* Kerberos ID
* MIT ID Number
* Cellphone Number

# Step 2: Paperwork Approval

Once I receive your request and information, I will submit the paperwork for approval.
Know that once I submit the paperwork, **the approval process is (unfortunately) out of my hands** -- in the past, approval process can be as quick as a few days (yay!) or as long as a few weeks (boo!). 
That being said, I do send weekly "reminder/nudge" emails to the approvers as long as I have an outstanding request.

I appreciate your patience!

# Step 3: Approved

When I hear your paperwork has been approved, I will let you know. After approval, the door access can take up to 24hrs to propogate (but in practice, this appears to be approximately 5mins).
