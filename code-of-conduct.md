# Code of Conduct

## Lab members are expected to treat each other with respect and consideration at all times.

To ensure an effective learning community, this includes (but is not limited to):
* **A commitment to effective communication.**
    * Be responsive. Respond to Slack messages/emails within ~1 business day.
    * Follow agreed upon [protocols](http://popola.mit.edu/doku.php?id=protocols).
    * Communicate proactively when "unexpected hiccups" inevitably occur. I am happy to work to accommodate your specific circumstances, but I can't do that if I don't know what's going on!
        * For instance: lab work is taking longer than expected, course workload is extra heavy, there is a personal/family issue happening, etc.
* **A commitment to diversity and inclusion.**
    * Be tolerant of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs.
    * Give respectful consideration of othersâ€™ social identities, experiences, and differences.
* **A commitment to learning.**
    * Put in the work to learn and do research.
    * Ask for help when you are unsure.
    * Ask for clarification when I am unclear.
    * Follow through on your lab commitments (and communicate when you cannot).
    * Provide me with feedback and suggestions. These policies and procedures are an evolving process (I am learning with you!). I encourage you to approach me with thoughts or concerns as they arise. *I make it a priority to be approachable!*
